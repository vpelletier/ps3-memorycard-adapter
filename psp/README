Authentication daemon for PSP.

First, a word for people reviewing the code:
This code is a dirty, trial-and-error, probably overcomplex, bunch
of lines. It should be rewritten to improve its usability, and make it nicer
to read.

Use requirements:
- a PSP capable of runing homebrew programs
- a PS3
- a wifi network which can be accessed by the PSP
- a USB cable with A-type and mini-B-type connectors (for example, the one
  bundled with your PS3)
- a PSP-compatible memory stick

Compilation requirements:
- a working psp toolchain: http://ps2dev.org/psp/Tools/Toolchain

Compilation:
- run "make"

Installation:
- Create destination directory on the memory stick:
  mkdir $MS_ROOT/PSP/GAME/MCAuth
- Copy the server and its usb driver:
  cp EBOOT.PBP usbsnoopdriver/usbsnoopdriver.prx $MS_ROOT/PSP/GAME/MCAuth/

Usage:
- start MCAuth on your PSP
- select the network configuration to use
- on your PS3, enter the "PS/PS2 Memory card utility" submenu in the "game"
  menu and stay in it (if you are in the right menu, you should see the
  "Create a new internal memory card" option, along with your internal cards)
- plug your PSP to your PS3 with the USB cable

The auth daemon is ready to use.

Stopping the daemon:
- press the "home" button on the PSP
- confirm exit

How it works:
The PSP is used as a card reader simulator: it makes the PS3 believe it is
Sony's official PS1/PS2 USB memory card reader. This way, it makes the PS3
try to authenticate with it.
When a program needs to get the correct authentication answer for an initial
chanlenge value, it sends it to the PSP via WIFI. Upon receiving it, the PSP
will simulate the connection of the card reader, the PS3 will start the
authentication process and the PSP will send received chalenge value to the
PS3, and send back the authentication answer given by the PS3.
The whole process takes about one second per attempt.
